										<p> Allowing exploration, play, and curiosity to drive her works, Victoria’s creative identity is grounded in an intuitive form of artmaking.  Her early works express a search for artistic agency and desire to develop her own conception of what art is and what purpose it serves in her life. Her earlier process transitions from using art as a means for exploring and gaining footing in the art world to now engaging with art as a tool for reflection. Her current body of work arises from her reflection upon salient aspects of her life and personal identity, such as her recreation in the outdoors. The work serves as a vehicle for her to “talk through” these reflections and examine how these salient aspects of her life shape her being, perspectives, and engagement with the outside world.</p>  
										<p>	Victoria’s current body of work is inspired by her extensive travels and adventures in the outdoors. The work is grounded in a sense of place, communicating her reverence for the physical landscapes of the Blue Ridge mountains and various outdoor meccas she has grown to call home. Throughout her time in Virginia, Victoria’s most transformative experiences have stemmed from her devotion to the <a href="https://outdoorsatuva.org">Outdoors Club at UVA</a> and her summer work as an outdoor Trip Leader for youth. Her exposure to activities like backpacking, rock climbing, mountain biking, kayaking, and wilderness instruction has allowed her to form a close relationship with nature and examine it from the lens of an adventurer. This lens allows her to observe and explore the diverse textures, colors, light, and sensory interactions of natural landscapes. She absorbs these observations into her works, letting them to guide her play with abstract organic forms, tactile 3D space, and earthy materials. This play calls back to her roots in adventure and invites her work to arise from intuitive and emotive responses to the outside world she observes. Victoria relies on sculpture and painting to share these responses and bring life to her experiences and memories in outdoor spaces. Her sculptures invite viewers to receive the work through multiple senses and viewpoints and engage with something that feels tangible and real.</p>  
										<p> Not only has Victoria formed a relationship with nature itself, but also with the communities of people devoted to living and playing outside. The influence of these “dirtbags” and tree huggers, those who share a deep appreciation and protectiveness towards the outdoors, has sparked her curiosity about the type of meaning that nature can hold for someone’s life.  As she reflects upon how strongly her life and perspectives have been shaped by the outdoors community, she explores the broader human relationship with the outdoors. She questions how humans think about their natural world, interact with it, and form ideas about the purpose it serves. As a multicultural artist, her curiosity extends to examine how factors like culture, privilege, and dependence can influence how people connect with and form biases about nature. Just as she considers nature’s impact on her life, so too does she consider her human impact on the natural world. Her work explores this physical imprint as a starting point for understanding an individual and collective human responsibility towards caring for nature. The intention of Victoria’s work is to invite others, whether or not they consider themselves adventurers, to contemplate their individual relationship and shared human coexistence with nature. She urges others to think about their impact on the natural world and to notice how their observations can shape their actions and attitudes towards it. Her work primarily functions not as a call to action, but as a nudge towards awareness - an understanding of where we are and where we want to arrive in our relationship with nature.</p>
